# Proving Pythagora's Theorem

Most students skip over proving Pythagoras but such an exercise is wonderful for building up ones spatial reasoning.

What is the essence of the proof for Pyth? Its about proving that when you've 2 smaller things in the ratio of a right angle
that they'll add up to the big one.

If you intuitively think about trying to form squares from the edges of such a triangle you're right on the Euclid. This is
one of the earliest proofs done & simple as it is elegant. See how it works at
http://www.cut-the-knot.org/pythagoras/morey.shtml

Proofs for Pyth essentially fall into a few main categories:

## Area/Algebraic Proofs

Take the lines of the sides and build shapes on them; the area of the smaller shapes will equal the one built on the
hypotenuse. Maybe construct some half circles on the angles themselves then compare. Euclid's proof falls into this
category. They're simple, intuitive, and easy to prove.

It has been some manner of philosophic debate (literally philosophers like Shopenheauer have given their opinions on
Euclid's) whether Euclid's proof is really all that "good". Its unnecessarily complex (compared to say Baravelle) and really
not all that aestichically pleasing.

But when viewed in the context of the times Euclid's achievement is both natural, elegant & impressive. It flowed from a
time when geometry & mathematics were the same thing. Its no wonder that he liked proofs where shapes became other shapes.
Today we see his proof as full of unnecessary steps that convoluted the process.

But to the Greeks, squares forming triangles, that shared the same properties as the triangles they came form? This is
practically a religious proof. (To Pythagoras it would have been literally religious.).

Much of Greek mathematical thinking flows beautifully compared to the haphazard mathematics of today. Different thinkers
produce different thinking which is often bad for creating things that make sense. I'm looking at you America, adopt metric
assholes.

Perhaps this is why Greek thinkers where so successful compared to similar periods of history. The medieval period had an
roughly the same resources but dogmatic thinking kept them back for 100s of years until a new Greek period occurred, the
renaissance.

## Dissection/Rearrangement Proofs

Take a shape that matches the ratio of Pythagorean triangle (Equatorial) and build stuff with them. The "pretty" proofs fall into this
category.

## Differential Proofs

The connection between the smaller sides and hypo can be proven using calculus. The changes in one side will produce a
change in the hypotenuse, this ratio can be calculated.
