Understanding the semantics behind mathematics can give a much clearer conceptual understanding of math. There is some general apprehension form people about learning "dumb" things like the definition of an "operation" but this mentality leaves one witha  rotten foundation & at some point it will catch up with you. For some much sooner than others. Feynman once wrote about graduate students that didn't understand a thing. What separates people like Feynman from the oordinary masses. People like to attribute genius to something extra special, but its mostly just drive + self awareness.

Self awareness brings humility and willingness to ask the dumb questions. The things you think can be just googled, master them. Now enough of that lets move onward.

# Operation

Remember that order of operations that you memorized in a time so long ago you cant remember it? What exactly is an operation in the first place? Understanding exactly what a operation is reveals some of the basic semantics & terms we use in Algebra like "arity".

At its simplest an operation takes some inputs and return a value. All operations are functions but not all functions are
operations. Just like an operator is someone who performs stuff on stuff, an operation is something that performs actions on inputs and returns values.

An operator in mathematics is a symbolic representation of the operation. E.g "+" for the "addition" operation.     

Operands are as expected the objects on which an operation is performed.

# Arity

Arity refers to the number of arguments/operands a function or operation takes.

- A nullary function takes no arguments.
- A unary function takes one argument.
- A binary function takes two arguments.
- A ternary function takes three arguments.
- An n-ary function takes n arguments.

It might be a bit strange to think of anything other than binary function as being a function. We are notused to thinking of say the ternary operator `?` as being a function but it is.     

## Nullary
A nullary function is something that is constant. 
   

## Unary
A unary function is something that takes place on a single value e.g negation or increments. Examples

- Negative/negation `-2` 
- De-increment `--2` 
- Increment `++5` 
- Multiplicative inverse: `1/x`        

## Binary 

Binary operators are the classics you are already familiar with like multiplication, addition & subtraction etc.
