# Intro

A mathematics book covering everything from the properties of numbers to Enumerative combinatorics. Its my personal journal
of a mathematical journey from Archimedes to John Nash.

My learning style is very different from most but hopefully something interesting can be found inside for everyone. Have
Fun!

# Why such a math book

I've always wanted to do some serious math work but I've been held back my lack of a solid grasping of lower mathematics.
I'm tired of not understanding the math behind cosmic inflation or M-theory. Higher math will further my ability to
appreciate things that really intrigue me. But I cant get there without mastering some other stuff first. Lets master that
"other stuff".

I've been self taught since the age of nine. This combined with my Asperger's, has left me with odd gaps in my knowledge. So
I'm starting from the beginning and working my way back up to where I am now; and from there, who knows. This is bound to
produce a truly unique mathematics book; so perhaps it will end up useful to others in some way.
